# Weather_Report (Incomplete)
- **Problem Statement:** Developing a Weather Station for Pilani (where my University is located) and getting real-time data instead of prediction data from weather models. Cost and power optimization strategies were adopted for this project.<br/>
* **Time spent in development:** 5 months (Jan 2023 to May 2023)<br/>
+ **Components used:** NodeMCU, DHT11 Sensor, ZH03B AQI Sensor, 12V-12W Solar Panel, Waveshare Solar Power Management Module.<br/>
- **Output:** the NodeMCU having connected to the internet is posting the real time weather data to a serverless webapp that has been deployed using AWS Amplify. This webapp also has a custom domain name for ease of access. The weather data includes the temperature, humidity, and AQI of Pilani, along with time that is being acquired from an NTP server.
