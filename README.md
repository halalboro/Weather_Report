# Weather_Report (Incomplete)
- Develop a weather station for Pilani and publish real-time data instead of prediction data from weather models. Cost and power optimization strategies were adopted for this project.<br/>
+ **Components used:** NodeMCU, DHT11 Sensor, ZH03B AQI Sensor, 12V-12W Solar Panel, Waveshare Solar Power Management Module.<br/>
- **Output:** The NodeMCU, having connected to the internet, is posting the real-time weather data to a web app deployed using Vercel. This web app also has a custom domain name for ease of access. The weather data includes the temperature, humidity, and AQI of Pilani, along with time that is being acquired from an NTP server.
- **Progress:** The Webapp deployment is still pending.
